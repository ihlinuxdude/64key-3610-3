üö® **CRITICAL DISCOVERY!** The build command is still using the snippet!

Looking at your build log, I can see the **exact problem**:

```bash
Run west build -s zmk/app -d "/tmp/tmp.TI7loM78w4" -b "nice_nano_v2" -S "studio-rpc-usb-uart"
```

The GitHub Actions workflow is **still passing** `-S "studio-rpc-usb-uart"` in the build command! This means your `build.yaml` changes aren't taking effect, or there's a cached/different workflow file being used.

## üîç **The Real Issue**

Your changes to `build.yaml` aren't being used. The workflow is still running with the old configuration that includes the snippet.

## üîß **IMMEDIATE FIXES**

### **Option 1: Force Rebuild from Your Branch**

1. **Check if your `build.yaml` changes are actually committed:**
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -n 5
```

2. **If not committed, commit and push:**
```bash
git add build.yaml
git commit -m "Remove studio-rpc-usb-uart snippet from build matrix"
git push origin clean-trackball-fix
```

### **Option 2: Check Your Current `build.yaml`**

Can you show me what your `build.yaml` currently contains? It should look like:

```yaml
# build.yaml (CORRECT VERSION)
include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: charybdis_nano_left
    
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: charybdis_nano_right
    cmake-args: -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO_LOCKING=n
    # NO snippet line here!
```

### **Option 3: Check if You Have Multiple Workflow Files**

```bash
# Search for any workflow files that might override build.yaml
find . -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.yaml" | grep -E "(build|workflow)"
```

## üéØ **The Problem is Clear**

The log shows:
- `-- Snippet(s): studio-rpc-usb-uart`
- `Merged configuration '...zmk/app/snippets/studio-rpc-usb-uart/studio-rpc-usb-uart.conf'`

This proves the snippet is still being loaded, which contains the problematic `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL` setting.

## üìã **Next Steps**

1. **Share your current `build.yaml` file contents**
2. **Confirm your changes are committed to the branch**
3. **Check if there are other workflow files**

Once we see your actual `build.yaml`, I can tell you exactly what needs to be fixed. The solution is simple - we just need to ensure the snippet is actually removed from the build configuration! üéØ
