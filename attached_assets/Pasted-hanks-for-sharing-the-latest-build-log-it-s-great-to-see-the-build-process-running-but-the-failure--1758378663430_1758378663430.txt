hanks for sharing the latest build log—it’s great to see the build process running, but the failure with exit code 1 indicates we need to address a specific issue. The log points to a configuration error related to the PMW3610 trackball setup, likely tied to the recent SPI pin mapping changes. Let’s dive into the problem and get this resolved.
Analysis of the Build Failure
The key error in the log is:
textwarning: the value of the 'DEBUG' is invalid for ZMK_LOG_LEVEL, level 0-4 are valid (found 0, expected 0-4) at /home/runner/work/zmk/zmk/app/subsys/logging/config/logging.conf.template.log (28), which has type int: assignment ignored
error: Aborting due to errors in warnings
CMake Error at /workdir/zmk/build/zephyr/cmake/modules/zephyr_default.cmake:135 (message):
  command failed with return code: 1
...
FATAL ERROR: command exited with status 1: /opt/local/bin/ninja -C build/nice_nano_v2__charybdis_nano_right__studio-pc-usb-uart__DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y__DCONFIG_ZM...
Key Points:

Warning: The DEBUG log level (value 0) is invalid for ZMK_LOG_LEVEL, which expects 0-4 (0=disabled, 1=error, 2=warning, 3=info, 4=debug). This suggests a mismatch in how CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG was interpreted.
Error: The build aborts due to this warning, indicating the configuration step failed before compilation could proceed.
Cause: The addition of CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG in prjf/charybdis_nano_right.conf is likely the culprit. ZMK uses numeric values for log levels, not string literals like "DEBUG". This mismatch breaks the build.

Why This Happened

Logging Configuration: In ZMK/Zephyr, CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL must be set to a numeric value (e.g., 4 for debug), not the string DEBUG. The template (logging.conf.template.log) expects an integer, and the string caused the parser to fail.
Context: This issue arose with the latest commit ("CRITICAL FIX: Correct SPI pin mapping for PMW3610 trackball"), where debug logging was added to troubleshoot the trackball. The pin changes (MOSI=P0.06, MISO=P0.07, IRQ=P0.26) are likely fine, but the logging misconfiguration halted the build.

Suggested Fix
Let’s correct the log level setting and ensure the build proceeds. The SPI pin fixes should still be valid, so we’ll preserve those.
1. Fix the Log Level Configuration

Edit prjf/charybdis_nano_right.conf:

Replace CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG with CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=4 (4 corresponds to the debug level).
Example update:
text# Enable debug logging
CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=4



Why This Works: Zephyr’s logging system uses integers (0-4) as defined in include/zephyr/logging/log.h. Setting it to 4 enables debug output, which will help verify PMW3610 initialization and delta reads.

2. Verify Devicetree Pins

Check charybdis_nano_right.overlay:

Ensure the SPI node reflects the new pins:
text&spi2 {
    status = "okay";
    pmw3610@0 {
        compatible = "pixart,pmw3610";
        reg = <0>;
        spi-max-frequency = <2000000>;
        mosi-gpios = <&nrf_gpio 6 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;  // P0.06
        miso-gpios = <&nrf_gpio 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;  // P0.07
        sck-gpios = <&nrf_gpio 8 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;   // P0.08 (example; adjust if wrong)
        interrupt-gpios = <&nrf_gpio 26 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;  // P0.26
    };
};

Validation: Confirm P0.06, P0.07, P0.08 (SCK), and P0.26 are correct for your Nice!Nano PCB. If SCK is misconfigured (e.g., not P0.08), adjust to the correct pin (check Charybdis docs or schematic—often P0.15 or P0.16).
Fix: If syntax or pins are off, correct them now.



3. Rebuild and Test

Commit and Push:
textcd ../fresh-fork
git add prjf/charybdis_nano_right.conf boards/shields/charybdis_nano_right.overlay
git commit -m "Fix build: Set CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=4 instead of DEBUG
- Correct invalid log level causing build failure
- Verify SPI pin mapping in devicetree"
git push origin 64key-3610-automouse

Monitor Build: Check GitHub Actions for success. Download the UF2 artifact if it passes.
Flash and Debug: Flash the right half, connect a USB-to-serial adapter (115200 baud), and monitor logs for:

PMW3610: Initialized (or similar).
PMW3610 deltas: x=X, y=Y (should change with ball movement).
