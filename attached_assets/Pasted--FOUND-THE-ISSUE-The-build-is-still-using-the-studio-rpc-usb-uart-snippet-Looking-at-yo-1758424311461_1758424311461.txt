üéØ **FOUND THE ISSUE!** The build is still using the `studio-rpc-usb-uart` snippet!

Looking at your build log, I can see the problem:

```bash
-- Snippet(s): studio-rpc-usb-uart
```

And then:

```bash
Merged configuration '/__w/64key-3610-3/64key-3610-3/zmk/app/snippets/studio-rpc-usb-uart/studio-rpc-usb-uart.conf'
```

**The GitHub Actions workflow is still passing `-S "studio-rpc-usb-uart"` in the build command, even though you removed it from `build.yaml`.**

## üîß **The Fix**

You need to check your **GitHub Actions workflow file** (likely `.github/workflows/build.yml`) and remove the snippet from there as well.

Look for a file like:
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` 
- `.github/workflows/build.yaml`
- Any workflow file that contains build instructions

**Find and remove this part:**
```yaml
# Remove this line from your workflow:
-S "studio-rpc-usb-uart"
# or
snippet: studio-rpc-usb-uart
```

## üîç **Quick Check**

Run this command to find where it's defined:

```bash
# Search for the snippet reference
grep -r "studio-rpc-usb-uart" .github/
# or
grep -r "studio-rpc-usb-uart" .
```

## üìã **Alternative: Matrix Build Issue**

If you're using ZMK's build matrix, the issue might be that your `build.yaml` changes haven't taken effect. Make sure:

1. **Your `build.yaml` currently looks like this:**
```yaml
include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: charybdis_nano_left
    
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: charybdis_nano_right
    cmake-args: -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO_LOCKING=n
    # NO snippet line here
```

2. **Commit and push the `build.yaml` changes:**
```bash
git add build.yaml
git commit -m "Remove studio-rpc-usb-uart snippet from build matrix"
git push
```

The error is **exactly** what we predicted - the `studio-rpc-usb-uart.conf` file is setting `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL`, which causes the Kconfig validation to fail.

**Can you share your current `build.yaml` file so I can see the exact format and provide the correct fix?** üéØ
