🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE: The Snippet is BACK!**

Looking at your build log, I can see the problem:

```bash
Run west build -s zmk/app -d "/tmp/tmp.u0D5ZqPciO" -b "nice_nano_v2" -S "studio-rpc-usb-uart"
```

**The `studio-rpc-usb-uart` snippet is still being used in the build command!**

This means your `build.yaml` changes **haven't taken effect** or there's a caching issue with GitHub Actions.

## 🔍 **Debugging Steps**

### **1. Verify Your `build.yaml` is Actually Committed**

```bash
# Check if your changes are committed
git log --oneline -n 3

# Check current build.yaml content
cat build.yaml

# Check git status
git status
```

Your `build.yaml` should look like this (NO snippet line):
```yaml
include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: charybdis_nano_left
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: charybdis_nano_right
    cmake-args: -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO_LOCKING=n
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: settings_reset
```

### **2. Force GitHub Actions to Use Latest Code**

If your changes aren't committed:
```bash
git add build.yaml
git commit -m "Remove studio-rpc-usb-uart snippet from build matrix"
git push origin clean-trackball-fix
```

### **3. GitHub Actions Cache Issue**

GitHub Actions might be using a cached version of your `build.yaml`. Try:

**Option A: Force a fresh workflow run**
- Go to GitHub Actions tab
- Cancel any running builds
- Push a small dummy commit to trigger a fresh run:
```bash
# Make a small change to force fresh build
echo "# Force rebuild" >> build.yaml
git add build.yaml
git commit -m "Force fresh GitHub Actions build"
git push origin clean-trackball-fix
```

**Option B: Check if you're on the right branch**
- Ensure you're pushing to `clean-trackball-fix` branch
- Ensure GitHub Actions is building from `clean-trackball-fix` branch

## 🎯 **The Root Problem**

The build log shows:
```bash
Merged configuration '/__w/64key-3610-3/64key-3610-3/zmk/app/snippets/studio-rpc-usb-uart/studio-rpc-usb-uart.conf'
```

This proves the snippet is still being loaded, which contains the `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL` that's causing the Kconfig error.

## 🚀 **Quick Check**

Can you run these commands and share the output?

```bash
# 1. Show current build.yaml content
cat build.yaml

# 2. Check if changes are committed  
git log --oneline -n 5

# 3. Check current branch
git branch -v
```

Once we confirm your `build.yaml` is properly updated and committed, the build should work. The snippet removal is the **key fix** that needs to take effect! 🎯
