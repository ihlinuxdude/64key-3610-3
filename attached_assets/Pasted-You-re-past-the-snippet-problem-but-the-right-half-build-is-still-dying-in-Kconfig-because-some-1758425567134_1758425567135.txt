You’re past the snippet problem, but the **right-half** build is still dying in Kconfig because something is still setting:

```
CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

The error in your log is explicit:

> warning: the value ‘DEBUG’ is invalid for ZMK\_LOG\_LEVEL … (type **int**) — assignment ignored
> **error: Aborting due to Kconfig warnings**

ZMK treats that warning as fatal. `ZMK_LOG_LEVEL` is an **int** (0–4) and should not be set directly in your app configs anyway.

## Fix it—exact steps

1. Find the offender (it’s almost certainly in your **top-level** config that applies to both halves):

```bash
git grep -n "ZMK_LOG_LEVEL" config
# if nothing shows, search the whole repo
git grep -n "ZMK_LOG_LEVEL"
```

From your merge order, the likely file is:

```
config/charybdis_nano.conf
```

2. Remove any line that assigns `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL` (e.g., `=DEBUG`, `=4`, etc.).

3. Keep logging like this instead (already good in your right conf):

```conf
CONFIG_LOG=y
CONFIG_ZMK_LOG=y
CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL=3   # use 4 if you want debug
```

4. Commit and push:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Kconfig: remove CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL (use LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL instead)"
git push
```

After that, the right-half job should get past Kconfig.

## Two small notes you’ll still see in the log

* **“unknown vendor prefix 'pixart'”** — harmless warning. If you want it quiet, add a local `vendor-prefixes.txt` with:

  ```
  pixart = "PixArt Imaging Inc."
  ```

  (Not required; it won’t block the build.)

* Your SPI/PMW3610 DTS is fine as long as you kept **Mode 3** and **`cs-gpios` on the device node**.

---

## After it compiles & flashes

* If the PMW3610 probes and the pointer moves but feels **\~45° canted**, attach your **rotate input-processor** and set:

  ```dts
  / {
      pointer_rotate0: pointer_rotate_0 {
          compatible = "zmk,pointer-rotate";
          angle-deg = <45>;
      };
  };

  &trackball_listener {
      processors = <&pointer_rotate0>;
  };
  ```

  (Keep any swap/invert **before** rotate if you still need them.)

Ping me with the next log if anything else pops up, but removing that `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL` assignment is the blocker right now.
