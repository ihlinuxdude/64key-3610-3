Great catch on the outdated `west` version in Replit and the critical SPI pin configuration error flagged by the architect‚Äîyour systematic approach is paying off! Switching to GitHub Actions is the right move given Replit's limitations, and fixing the MISO pin assignment resolves a fundamental electrical issue that would have prevented trackball communication. Let‚Äôs validate the fixes, guide you through the process, and prepare for testing.

### Validation of Applied Fixes
Your updates address both the build environment limitation and the hardware configuration issue:

1. **Replit Environment Limitation**:
   - **Issue**: Replit‚Äôs `west 0.11.0` lacks the `build` command, which was introduced in later versions (e.g., 0.14.0+). This explains the local build failures.
   - **Fix**: Switching to GitHub Actions leverages the already-fixed workflow, avoiding Replit‚Äôs outdated tools. Your prior resolution of the `studio-rpc-usb-uart` snippet issue in `build.yaml` ensures compatibility.

2. **Critical SPI Pin Configuration Error**:
   - **Root Cause**: Setting both MOSI and MISO to P0.24 was electrically impossible for 4-wire SPI, as MOSI (Master Out) and MISO (Master In) must be distinct pins. The PMW3610, despite some Pixart sensors supporting 3-wire mode, typically uses 4-wire SPI in ZMK implementations (SCK, MOSI, MISO, CS), as confirmed by community docs and the architect‚Äôs review.
   - **Fix**: Moving MISO to P0.17 restores a valid 4-wire configuration (SCK=P0.22, MOSI=P0.24, MISO=P0.17, CS=P0.20, IRQ=P0.26). This aligns with the nRF52832‚Äôs SPI capabilities and your hardware setup.
   - **Impact**: This should enable proper SPI communication, allowing the PMW3610 to send delta data.

3. **Configuration Consistency**:
   - The clean `charybdis_nano_right.conf` and updated overlay with SPI Mode 3 (`spi-cpha;`, `spi-cpol;`) remain intact, ensuring logging and trackball settings are correctly applied.

### Updated Configuration Review
- **build.yaml** (unchanged from last successful run, snippet removed):
  ```
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: charybdis_nano_right
    cmake-args: -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO_LOCKING=n
  ```

- **charybdis_nano_right.conf** (unchanged, clean):
  ```
  CONFIG_SPI=y
  CONFIG_INPUT=y
  CONFIG_ZMK_POINTING=y
  CONFIG_ZMK_EXT_POWER=y
  CONFIG_LOG=y
  CONFIG_ZMK_LOG=y
  CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL=3
  CONFIG_PMW3610=y
  CONFIG_PMW3610_CPI=1600
  CONFIG_PMW3610_CPI_DIVIDER=4
  CONFIG_PMW3610_SNIPE_CPI=200
  CONFIG_PMW3610_SNIPE_CPI_DIVIDER=1
  CONFIG_PMW3610_SCROLL_TICK=60
  CONFIG_PMW3610_SWAP_XY=y
  CONFIG_PMW3610_INVERT_X=y
  CONFIG_PMW3610_INVERT_Y=y
  ```

- **charybdis_nano_right.overlay** (updated SPI pinctrl):
  ```
  &spi0 {
      status = "okay";
      pinctrl-0 = <&spi0_default>;
      pinctrl-1 = <&spi0_sleep>;
      pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
  };
  &pinctrl {
      spi0_default: spi0_default {
          group1 {
              psels = <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_SCK, 0, 22)>,
                      <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MOSI, 0, 24)>,
                      <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MISO, 0, 17)>;  // Fixed to P0.17
          };
      };
      spi0_sleep: spi0_sleep {
          group1 {
              psels = <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_SCK, 0, 22)>,
                      <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MOSI, 0, 24)>,
                      <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MISO, 0, 17)>;
              low-power-enable;
          };
      };
  };
  &spi0 {
      trackball: trackball@0 {
          status = "okay";
          compatible = "pixart,pmw3610";
          reg = <0>;
          spi-max-frequency = <2000000>;
          cs-gpios = <&gpio0 20 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
          irq-gpios = <&gpio0 26 (GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW | GPIO_PULL_UP)>;
          spi-cpha;
          spi-cpol;
          scroll-layers = <1>;
          snipe-layers = <2>;
      };
  };
  ```

This configuration should now build successfully and support proper 4-wire SPI communication.

### Next Steps
Your GitHub Actions approach is the way to go‚Äîhere‚Äôs the detailed process:

1. **Commit and Push the SPI Fix**:
   ```
   cd 64key-3610-3
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Critical fix: Correct SPI MISO pin from P0.24 to P0.17 for PMW3610"
   git push origin clean-trackball-fix
   ```
   - This triggers GitHub Actions. Monitor the build on the Actions tab of your `64key-3610-3` repo (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username, e.g., `https://github.com/ihlinuxdude/64key-3610-3`).

2. **Check GitHub Actions Build**:
   - Look for a ‚úÖ green checkmark for the latest workflow run on the `clean-trackball-fix` branch.
   - If it fails, expand the log for errors (e.g., DTS syntax, pin conflicts) and share the relevant lines.

3. **Download the Firmware**:
   - Click on the successful workflow run.
   - Scroll to the ‚ÄúArtifacts‚Äù section.
   - Download the ZIP file containing the `.uf2` files (e.g., `charybdis_nano_right-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2` and the left half file).
   - Extract the ZIP to access the files.

4. **Flash and Test**:
   - **Right Half (Trackball Side)**:
     - Double-tap reset on the right Nice!Nano to enter bootloader mode.
     - Drag `charybdis_nano_right-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2` onto the `NICE_NANO` drive.
     - The LED should blink, then the drive should disappear.
   - **Left Half (Optional)**:
     - Repeat with the left half‚Äôs UF2 file for full keyboard functionality.
   - Test the trackball:
     - Roll in all directions‚Äîcursor should move.
     - Check direction: ‚ÄúForward‚Äù roll should move mostly up, adjusted by `SWAP_XY` + `INVERT_X` + `INVERT_Y`.

5. **Review Logs**:
   - Connect a USB-to-serial adapter (P0.00/TX, P0.01/RX, GND at 115200 baud).
   - Use a terminal (e.g., PuTTY) to view logs.
   - Look for:
     - `PMW3610: Initialized` (sensor startup).
     - `PMW3610 deltas: x=X, y=Y` (delta changes with movement).
   - If no logs, ensure `LOG_MODULE_REGISTER(pmw3610, CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL);` is in `pmw3610.c` (add if missing, rebuild, and reflash).

### What to Expect
- **Build Success**: The corrected MISO pin and prior config fixes should result in a green build.
- **Trackball Behavior**:
  - **‚úÖ If Moves but Tracks ~45¬∞ Diagonal**: SPI communication is working! üéâ The issue is the orientation transformation. Implement the rotation matrix:
    ```
    int16_t temp_x = delta_x;
    int16_t cos45 = 7071;  // 0.7071 * 10000
    int16_t sin45 = 7071;  // 0.7071 * 10000
    delta_x = (temp_x * cos45 - delta_y * sin45) / 10000;
    delta_y = (temp_x * sin45 + delta_y * cos45) / 10000;
    ```
    - Add this in `pmw3610.c` after delta reads, commit, push, rebuild, and flash the right half. Test again‚Äîcursor should move straight up.
  - **‚ùå If No Movement**: Check logs for initialization errors (e.g., ‚ÄúSPI read failed‚Äù) or zero deltas. Verify PCB wiring (SCK=P0.22, MOSI=P0.24, MISO=P0.17, CS=P0.20, IRQ=P0.26) against your Aliexpress hardware. Adjust pins if needed.

### Action Plan
- Commit and push the SPI fix.
- Monitor the GitHub Actions build.
- Flash, test, and review logs.
- Report back with build status, movement behavior, or log output‚ÄîI‚Äôll guide the next tweak.
