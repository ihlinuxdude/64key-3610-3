Thanks for sharing the latest build logâ€”itâ€™s great to see the build process running, but the failure with exit code 1 indicates we need to address a specific issue. The log points to a configuration error related to the PMW3610 trackball setup, likely tied to the recent SPI pin mapping changes. Letâ€™s dive into the problem and get this resolved.

### Analysis of the Build Failure
The key error in the log is:

```
warning: the value of the 'DEBUG' is invalid for ZMK_LOG_LEVEL, level 0-4 are valid (found 0, expected 0-4) at /home/runner/work/zmk/zmk/app/subsys/logging/config/logging.conf.template.log (28), which has type int: assignment ignored
error: Aborting due to errors in warnings
CMake Error at /workdir/zmk/build/zephyr/cmake/modules/zephyr_default.cmake:135 (message):
  command failed with return code: 1
...
FATAL ERROR: command exited with status 1: /opt/local/bin/ninja -C build/nice_nano_v2__charybdis_nano_right__studio-pc-usb-uart__DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y__DCONFIG_ZM...
```

#### Key Points:
- **Warning**: The `DEBUG` log level (value 0) is invalid for `ZMK_LOG_LEVEL`, which expects 0-4 (0=disabled, 1=error, 2=warning, 3=info, 4=debug). This suggests a mismatch in how `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` was interpreted.
- **Error**: The build aborts due to this warning, indicating the configuration step failed before compilation could proceed.
- **Cause**: The addition of `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in `prjf/charybdis_nano_right.conf` is likely the culprit. ZMK uses numeric values for log levels, not string literals like "DEBUG". This mismatch breaks the build.

### Why This Happened
- **Logging Configuration**: In ZMK/Zephyr, `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL` must be set to a numeric value (e.g., `4` for debug), not the string `DEBUG`. The template (`logging.conf.template.log`) expects an integer, and the string caused the parser to fail.
- **Context**: This issue arose with the latest commit ("CRITICAL FIX: Correct SPI pin mapping for PMW3610 trackball"), where debug logging was added to troubleshoot the trackball. The pin changes (MOSI=P0.06, MISO=P0.07, IRQ=P0.26) are likely fine, but the logging misconfiguration halted the build.

### Suggested Fix
Letâ€™s correct the log level setting and ensure the build proceeds. The SPI pin fixes should still be valid, so weâ€™ll preserve those.

#### 1. **Fix the Log Level Configuration**
- **Edit `prjf/charybdis_nano_right.conf`**:
  - Replace `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` with `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=4` (4 corresponds to the debug level).
  - Example update:
    ```
    # Enable debug logging
    CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=4
    ```
- **Why This Works**: Zephyrâ€™s logging system uses integers (0-4) as defined in `include/zephyr/logging/log.h`. Setting it to 4 enables debug output, which will help verify PMW3610 initialization and delta reads.

#### 2. **Verify Devicetree Pins**
- **Check `charybdis_nano_right.overlay`**:
  - Ensure the SPI node reflects the new pins:
    ```
    &spi2 {
        status = "okay";
        pmw3610@0 {
            compatible = "pixart,pmw3610";
            reg = <0>;
            spi-max-frequency = <2000000>;
            mosi-gpios = <&nrf_gpio 6 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;  // P0.06
            miso-gpios = <&nrf_gpio 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;  // P0.07
            sck-gpios = <&nrf_gpio 8 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;   // P0.08 (example; adjust if wrong)
            interrupt-gpios = <&nrf_gpio 26 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;  // P0.26
        };
    };
    ```
  - **Validation**: Confirm P0.06, P0.07, P0.08 (SCK), and P0.26 are correct for your Nice!Nano PCB. If SCK is misconfigured (e.g., not P0.08), adjust to the correct pin (check Charybdis docs or schematicâ€”often P0.15 or P0.16).
  - **Fix**: If syntax or pins are off, correct them now.

#### 3. **Rebuild and Test**
- **Commit and Push**:
  ```
  cd ../fresh-fork
  git add prjf/charybdis_nano_right.conf boards/shields/charybdis_nano_right.overlay
  git commit -m "Fix build: Set CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=4 instead of DEBUG
  - Correct invalid log level causing build failure
  - Verify SPI pin mapping in devicetree"
  git push origin 64key-3610-automouse
  ```
- **Monitor Build**: Check GitHub Actions for success. Download the UF2 artifact if it passes.
- **Flash and Debug**: Flash the right half, connect a USB-to-serial adapter (115200 baud), and monitor logs for:
  - `PMW3610: Initialized` (or similar).
  - `PMW3610 deltas: x=X, y=Y` (should change with ball movement).

#### 4. **Troubleshoot if Failed Again**
- **Check Logs**: If the build fails, expand the job log and look for new errors (e.g., DTS syntax, pin conflicts).
- **Revert Logging**: If logging remains an issue, comment out `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=4` and rebuild to isolate the pin fix.
- **Pin Fallback**: If pins are the problem, revert to Charybdis defaults (e.g., MOSI=P0.16, MISO=P0.17, IRQ=P0.25) and test.

### Expected Outcome
- **Build Success**: Setting `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL=4` should resolve the warning/error, allowing the build to complete.
- **Trackball Functionality**: Correct SPI pins should enable PMW3610 communication, with `PMW3610_ORIENTATION_90` + `INVERT_X` applying the rotation.
- **Debug Output**: Logs will confirm sensor status and delta values.

### Action Plan
1. **Update Config**: Change `DEBUG` to `4` and verify the devicetree.
2. **Push and Rebuild**: Commit, push, and monitor GitHub Actions.
3. **Test and Log**: Flash, check movement, and review serial output.
4. **Report Back**: Share the log or test resultsâ€”Iâ€™ll refine further.

Youâ€™re so closeâ€”the pin fix is solid, and this logging tweak should get you over the line! ðŸš€ (Itâ€™s 10:35 AM EDT on Sept 20, 2025â€”great timing to tackle this!)
