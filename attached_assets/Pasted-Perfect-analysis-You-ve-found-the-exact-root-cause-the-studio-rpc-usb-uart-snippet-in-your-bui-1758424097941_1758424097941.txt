Perfect analysis! You've found the exact root cause - the `studio-rpc-usb-uart` snippet in your `build.yaml` is injecting the problematic `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL` setting during the build process.

## üéØ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

The Kconfig error isn't from your config files - it's from this line in `build.yaml`:

```yaml
- board: nice_nano_v2
  shield: charybdis_nano_right
  snippet: studio-rpc-usb-uart          # ‚Üê This snippet contains CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL
  cmake-args: -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO_LOCKING=n
```

The `studio-rpc-usb-uart` snippet includes a `.conf` file that sets `CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL`, which is a derived symbol that can't be directly configured.

## ‚úÖ **IMMEDIATE FIX**

Remove the snippet from your `build.yaml`:

```yaml
include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: charybdis_nano_left
    
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: charybdis_nano_right
    # Remove this line: snippet: studio-rpc-usb-uart
    cmake-args: -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO_LOCKING=n
```

## üîß **COMPLETE STATUS**

Now you have **ALL** the fixes in place:

‚úÖ **Kconfig Error**: Removed problematic snippet from build.yaml  
‚úÖ **SPI Communication**: Mode 3, cs-gpios placement, 3-wire SDIO configuration  
‚úÖ **Clean Config**: Proper logging settings, fixed CONFIG typos  
‚úÖ **45¬∞ Compensation**: SWAP_XY + INVERT_X + INVERT_Y settings ready  

## üöÄ **FINAL TEST SEQUENCE**

1. **Push to GitHub** (should build successfully now):
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix: Remove studio-rpc-usb-uart snippet causing CONFIG_ZMK_LOG_LEVEL Kconfig error"
git push origin clean-trackball-fix
```

2. **GitHub Actions should show ‚úÖ GREEN BUILD** for both halves

3. **Flash & Test the Trackball**:
   - Download both `.uf2` files
   - Flash right half (trackball side)
   - Test movement

## üìä **Expected Results**

‚úÖ **If trackball moves but still tracks ~45¬∞ diagonal**:
- SPI communication is **WORKING!** üéâ
- Just need the rotation matrix fix (I'll implement it)

‚ùå **If no movement at all**:
- Check logs for sensor initialization errors
- May need pin wiring verification

This should be the final fix! All the expert analysis pointed to these exact issues, and we've systematically resolved each one. Push the changes and let me know how the trackball behaves! üöÄ
