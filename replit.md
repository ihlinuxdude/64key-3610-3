# Project Documentation

## Overview

This repository appears to be empty or the contents were not provided for analysis. This template replit.md file should be updated once the project structure and codebase are available.

To properly document this project, we would need to analyze:
- The main application files and directory structure
- Package.json or equivalent dependency files
- Configuration files
- Database schemas or models
- API endpoints or routes
- Frontend components and architecture

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

**Note: This section requires analysis of the actual codebase to provide accurate architectural information.**

Key areas to document once code is available:
- **Frontend Architecture**: Framework choice, component structure, state management
- **Backend Architecture**: Server framework, routing patterns, middleware usage
- **Data Layer**: Database choice, ORM/query builder, schema design
- **Authentication**: Authentication strategy and session management
- **API Design**: REST/GraphQL patterns, endpoint structure
- **Build & Deployment**: Build tools, deployment strategy

## External Dependencies

**Note: This section requires analysis of package.json and configuration files.**

Categories to document:
- **Core Frameworks**: Primary frontend/backend frameworks
- **Database**: Database system and connection libraries
- **Authentication Services**: Third-party auth providers
- **External APIs**: Third-party service integrations
- **Development Tools**: Build tools, testing frameworks, linting tools
- **Deployment Services**: Hosting platforms, CI/CD services
